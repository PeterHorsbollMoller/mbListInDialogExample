# mbListInDialogExample

This tool shows a dialog with two listboxes and a PopupMenu.

When selecting a continent from the PopupMenu, the first Listbox populates with countries from that continent.
The user can now double click on countries to move them to the other ListBox

In the code, I'm using some procedures and functions from the ARRAYLib to add and remove elements to and from the arrays.
ARRAYLib also has a function that can check if a value already exists in an array.

The sourcecode also shows how to use handles in combination with Dialog Load and Controls
